  Architecture of a sparse autoencoder showing the encoding-decoding process
  with sparse hidden layer activations. The diagram illustrates how sparsity
  constraints in the hidden layer (shown in green with varying transparency
  indicating activation strength) lead to more efficient and interpretable
  feature representations. Input and output layers are shown in blue, with the
  sparse hidden layer demonstrating selective activation patterns that encourage
  the network to learn meaningful, sparse representations of the input data.
